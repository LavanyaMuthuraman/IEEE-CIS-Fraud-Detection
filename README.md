### Description:
In day today's electronic world ,almost everyone make a transaction either in shopping mall or in booking movie tickets or flight tickets etc.So fraud transaction can happen in any of these places which will penalize the customer heavily as well as the businesses. Hence improving the efficacy of fraudulent transaction alerts for millions of people around the world and helping hundreds of thousands of businesses reduce their fraud loss and increase their revenue.

**The IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection competition was held on Kaggle during 2019 and focused on benchmarking Machine Learning models on a large-scale transaction dataset. The task was a binary classification task: classify an online transaction as fraud or not fraud .**

Decided to explore this dataset on our own and build models to detect online fraud. Our features and models are built keeping in mind if it is feasible to create a “product” out of our solution. 

In the jupyter notebook file, Initial Diagnostics, Dealing with Imbalanced Data and preparing it for a Random Forest Model training and  Hyper-Parameter Tuning in models to classifying the data.
